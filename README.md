# Medical Cost Personal Project

This project aims to analyze medical cost data using machine learning techniques. The primary algorithm used in this project is the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation of the model's performance.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Scales and prepares the data for modeling.
- **Classification**: Uses KNN to classify and predict outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Generates insights using visual plots.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `insurance.csv`. It includes medical cost information and associated attributes. Make sure the dataset is present in the project directory.

## Requirements

To run this project, install the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

Install these libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
